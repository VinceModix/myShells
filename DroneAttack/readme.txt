Why 802.11?

Wi-Fi is a key interface for many current quadcopters. Some use it as the interface between the controller and a tablet displaying mapping and telemetry data. A few drones, such as Parrot¡¯s Bebop and AR.Drone 2.0, are entirely controlled via Wi-Fi. This type of system lowers the barriers to entry into the drone space since pilots can use their own devices for control, but it does create interesting security situations since existing network-based attacks can now be used against these devices. Modern drones are essentially flying computers, so many of the attacks that were developed for use against traditional computer systems are also effective. The AR.Drone 2.0 in particular has many impressive features and sensors that users can access, and its low cost makes it an ideal platform for experimentation and learning.
